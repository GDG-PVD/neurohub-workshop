## Build With AI: Multi-Agent Systems for Neurotechnology

Part of the BGU-Brown Summer School on Embodied Brain Technology, this hands-on workshop demonstrates how to build production-ready multi-agent AI systems for neurotechnology research. You'll learn to create intelligent agents that can analyze biosignals, design experiments, and generate research documentation - all using Google's cutting-edge AI infrastructure.

**What You'll Build:**

- **Signal Processing Agent**: Analyzes EEG, EMG, and ECG data to identify patterns and anomalies
- **Experiment Designer Agent**: Creates research protocols based on your goals and available equipment
- **Documentation Agent**: Automatically generates formatted research reports and findings
- **Research Orchestrator**: Coordinates complex multi-step research workflows

**Technologies You'll Master:**

- **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)**: Build intelligent agents with Gemini 2.0
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Create tools that agents can use to interact with data
- **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol**: Enable collaboration between distributed AI agents
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Deploy your multi-agent system to production

**Workshop Modules:**

1. **Getting Started**: Set up your development environment and explore the NeuroHub platform
2. **Your First Agent**: Build and customize a research assistant using pre-built patterns
3. **Adding Tools**: Connect agents to databases and research equipment using MCP
4. **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Create agents that work together on complex tasks
5. **Agent Communication**: Implement A2A protocol for distributed agent collaboration
6. **Orchestration**: Build a master agent that coordinates specialized sub-agents
7. **Production Deployment**: Deploy your system to Google Cloud Run and Vertex AI

**Who Should Attend:**

- Neuroscience researchers looking to automate their workflows
- Developers interested in multi-agent AI architectures
- Students exploring the intersection of AI and brain-computer interfaces
- Anyone building applications that require coordinated AI agents

**What to Bring:**

- A Google Cloud account (free trial available)
- Basic Python knowledge
- Curiosity about AI agents and neurotechnology

**Workshop Outcomes:**

By the end of this workshop, you'll have:
- A working multi-agent system for neurotechnology research
- Hands-on experience with Google's agent development stack
- Production deployment skills for AI applications
- A foundation for building your own domain-specific AI agents

No prior experience with AI agents or neuroscience required - we'll guide you from basic concepts to production deployment!
