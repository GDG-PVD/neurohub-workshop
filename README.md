# NeuroHub: Multi-Agent AI for Embodied Brain Technology

## Overview

NeuroHub is a comprehensive workshop demonstrating how to build multi-agent AI systems for neurotechnology research and development. This platform showcases the integration of Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) in the context of brain-computer interfaces and biosignal analysis.

The original InstaVibe demo showcased multi-agent AI for social event planning. We've transformed it into NeuroHub, a platform for neurotechnology research, while maintaining the same architectural patterns and educational objectives. Used with permission from the author.

## Workshop Context
