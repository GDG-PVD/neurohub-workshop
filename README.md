# NeuroHub: Multi-Agent AI for Embodied Brain Technology

## Overview

NeuroHub is a comprehensive workshop demonstrating how to build multi-agent AI systems for neurotechnology research and development. This platform showcases the integration of Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) in the context of brain-computer interfaces and biosignal analysis.

This workshop is adapted from Christina Lin's "Google's Agent Stack in Action: ADK, A2A, MCP on Google Cloud" codelab, originally published at https://codelabs.developers.google.com/instavibe-adk-multi-agents/. 

The original InstaVibe demo showcased multi-agent AI for social event planning. We've transformed it into NeuroHub, a platform for neurotechnology research, while maintaining the same architectural patterns and educational objectives. Used with permission from the author.

## Workshop Context

This workshop was created for the **BGU-Brown Summer School: Embodied Brain Technology Practicum** (July 18-31, 2025), a collaborative program between Brown University and Ben-Gurion University focusing on:
- Neurotechnology development
- Brain-computer interfaces
- Biosignal processing
- Entrepreneurship in neurotech

## What You'll Learn

1. **Foundations with Google's ADK**: Build intelligent agents for biosignal analysis and experiment design
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Create tools for data processing and research documentation
3. **Agent Orchestration**: Design workflows for complex research tasks
4. **A2A Communication**: Enable collaboration between distributed research agents
5. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy your multi-agent system on Google Cloud Platform

## Architecture Overview

NeuroHub transforms the original social media architecture into a neurotechnology research platform:

### Original InstaVibe ‚Üí NeuroHub Transformation

| InstaVibe Component | NeuroHub Component | Purpose |

| Platform Interaction Agent | Documentation Agent | Generates research reports and findings |
| Posts & Events | Signal Data & Experiments | Research data and experimental protocols |
| Friends Network | Research Collaborations | Team connections and expertise |

### Key Components

1. **Signal Processing Agent**
   - Analyzes uploaded biosignal data (EEG, EMG, heart rate)
   - Identifies patterns and anomalies
   - Generates signal quality reports
   - Tracks signal ‚Üí experiment ‚Üí researcher relationships

2. **Experiment Designer Agent**
   - Creates experimental protocols based on research goals
   - Suggests equipment configurations
   - Generates testing schedules
   - Recommends participant criteria

3. **Documentation Agent**
   - Creates formatted research notebooks
   - Generates experiment reports
   - Publishes findings to the platform
   - Exports data for publication

4. **Orchestrator Agent**
   - Coordinates multi-step research workflows
   - Manages data flow between agents
   - Ensures proper documentation of all activities
