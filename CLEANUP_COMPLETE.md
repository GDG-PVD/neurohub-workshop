# NeuroHub Workshop Cleanup Complete

## Summary of Changes

This document summarizes the cleanup work completed to remove old InstaVibe social media code and fully transition to NeuroHub neurotechnology features.

## Files Removed

### Old Database Module
- `neurohub/db.py` - Contained old InstaVibe schema (Person, Friend, Post, Event)

### Old Templates
- `neurohub/templates/person.html` - Social profile page
- `neurohub/templates/event_detail.html` - Social event details
- `neurohub/templates/introvert_ally_post_status.html` - Social posting status
- `neurohub/templates/introvert_ally_review.html` - Social plan review

## Files Updated

### Core Application
- **`neurohub/app.py`** - Completely rewritten to:
  - Import from `db_neurohub` instead of inline SQL queries
  - Remove all social media routes (/person, /event, /api/posts, /api/events)
  - Add proper NeuroHub routes for researchers and experiments
  - Create placeholder API routes for experiments, analyses, and sessions

### Templates
- **`neurohub/templates/neurohub_ally.html`** - Transformed from social planning to research assistance
- **`neurohub/templates/researcher.html`** - Created new template for researcher profiles

### Routes
- **`neurohub/neurohub_routes.py`** - Completely rewritten to:
  - Remove IntrovertAlly social planning features
  - Add NeuroHub Ally research assistance
  - Add streaming endpoints for protocol generation and analysis

## Files Backed Up

All removed files were backed up to `old_instavibe_backup/` directory:
- `db.py`
- `person.html`
- `event_detail.html`
- `introvert_ally_post_status.html`
- `introvert_ally_review.html`
- `app_old.py`
- `neurohub_routes_old.py`

## What's Left

The codebase is now clean of InstaVibe social media features. The remaining work includes:

1. **Integration Testing** - Test agents with the new SQL-based queries
2. **End-to-End Testing** - Deploy to Cloud Run and verify functionality
3. **Agent Updates** - Ensure agents reference correct database schema
4. **Documentation Updates** - Update any remaining docs that reference old schema

## New Structure

The application now focuses entirely on neurotechnology research:
- **Researchers** instead of Persons
- **Experiments** instead of Events
- **Signal Data** instead of Posts
- **Collaborations** instead of Friendships
- **NeuroHub Ally** for research assistance instead of social planning

## Database

The application now uses:
- `db_neurohub.py` with SQL queries (Spanner Standard Edition compatible)
- Proper NeuroHub schema with research-focused tables
- No dependency on Property Graph features (Enterprise Edition)
