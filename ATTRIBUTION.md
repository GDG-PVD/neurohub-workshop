This NeuroHub workshop is adapted from:

**Original Work:** "Google's Agent Stack in Action: ADK, A2A, MCP on Google Cloud"
**Author:** Christina Lin
**Source:** https://codelabs.developers.google.com/instavibe-adk-multi-agents/
**License:** [Refer to original codelab terms]

## Modifications

This adaptation transforms the original social event planning platform (InstaVibe) into a neurotechnology research platform (NeuroHub) for the BGU-Brown Summer School on Embodied Brain Technology.

Key transformations:
- Social profiles → Researcher profiles and expertise
- Event planning → Experiment protocol design
- Social listening → Biosignal analysis
- Platform posting → Research documentation

The core architecture, patterns, and educational approach remain faithful to the original work.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to Christina Lin for creating the original codelab and granting permission for this educational adaptation.
