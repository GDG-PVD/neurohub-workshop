## Ready to Start?

If all items are checked, you're ready for the workshop! ðŸŽ‰

If you're missing any checkmarks:
1. Go back to that section in the setup guide
2. Complete the missing steps
3. Ask for help if needed

## Common Issues

**Missing ~/project_id.txt or ~/mapkey.txt:**
- These files should be in your home directory, not the project directory
- Run `ls ~/*.txt` to check

**Environment variables not set:**
- Make sure you used `source set_env.sh` not `./set_env.sh`
- Run the command again if needed

**Import errors when running Python scripts:**
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Check prompt shows `(.venv)`
- Re-run `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`
